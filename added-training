Besides the additions to the baseline code, we attempted to show 
the non-imperative issues with the training data. Some notable
characteristics about the existing data sets:

  1) There are no overlaps of verbs between the .trn, .dev and .tst sets. 
This should have prevented any inflation of the prediction accuracy.
  2) Each verb is presented and tested with around/at least 20 msd forms. 
This means that a good chunk of the conjugation paradigm is given or predicted. 
The lines are distributed between the different tense-aspect-moods. 
(It is unclear what the criteria is for choosing specific msd's for each verb, 
since they differ between verbs. Part of it is due to the grammatical cases 
associated with each.)
  3) The vast majority of the data are -ar verbs. This matches the distribution of 
ar-er-ir in the actual Spanish language. (The RAE estimate at least 80% of verbs being
of type -ar.) This leads to a the -er and -ir verbs being really underpresented and some 
of their special types being unrepresented. 
  4) No highly irregular verbs are included (eg. ir, ser, estar, tener),
though verbs that are irregular in ending (eg. subscribir) or stem changes (eg. dispertar)
do appear. 
  5) A large amount of the IMP data have an accusative case
